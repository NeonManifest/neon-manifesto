# neon-manifesto
An attempt to work on LaTeX on a new environment, making a TTRPG system out of all the things that I like about the genre without even trying to turn them into a cohesive whole.

# Project Goals
- Write a little bit often
- Register TTRPG mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics that I like
- Make the game I want to run and play, but in the format of a treatsie of everything I like regarding the hobby I've been passionate about for most of my life.
