\subsection{How to play Neon Manifesto}
In order to play Neon Manifesto, the following materials are needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Six-sided dice, that will be dubbed d6 in this game. One is fine, but this game rolls up to 8 at a time;}
\item {Twelve-sided dice, that will be dubbed d12 in this game. One is enough for any roll in this game;}
\item {Pencil and paper, at least one and one sheet for each person playing;}
\item {Most importantly, boundless imagination.}
\end{itemize}

In this game, players gather on a table and take on two distinct roles: the CONDUCTOR is responsible for setting the stage of the game world, preparing adventures, and adjudicating rules. Other players are responsible for controlling a single character -- or a small group of characters -- in the game world, these are dubbed PLAYERS.

Chapter \ref{sec:adventure} describes all procedures of play in detail but the standard game loop is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The CONDUCTOR describes the situation, setting the stage for the players;
    \item A PLAYER declares an action, describing what their character does to respond to or interact with the situation;
    \item Die rolls are made as necessary to determine the outcome of the declared action;
    \item The CONDUCTOR narrates the result of the action, updating the situation based on the outcome;
    \item The play procedure begins anew.
\end{itemize}
