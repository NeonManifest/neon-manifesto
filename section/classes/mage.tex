\subsubsection*{Starting Skills}
A Mage always begins with Spell 3. Roll 1d6 on the table to determine your Mage's other starting skills. You may also choose a line.

\subsubsection*{Magic Spells}
Since they have the Spell skill, a Mage can use a magic tool to cast spells. Chapter \ref{sec:magic} descibes the rules for learning casting spells in Neon Manifesto. Mages are not restricted by discipline when learning spells due to the character's Spell skill value.
