\subsection{Chump}
The weakest class, a Chump is a commoner of the world, starting at level 0 and requiring a single EXPERIENCE to level up to 1. There is nothing special about playing the Chump other than the challenge, the excitement of being weak, and drama potential of the class, and being a bit more skilled when they get to level 1.

\subsubsection*{Class Change}
Once the chump reaches level 1, they roll on the Class Change table instead of rolling for a talent. It's possible that a Chump that wasn't an animal or a being of imagination becomes a Talking Animal or an Imagined. This is intended. Chumps get to use the HIT VALUE and HITS of their new class, get to keep their skills and add the new class' skills through the starting skills table, and their appearence can be changed through the new class' appearence table.
