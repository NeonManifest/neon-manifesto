\subsection{Chump}
The weakest class, a Chump is a commoner of the world, starting at level 0 and requiring a single EXPERIENCE to level up to 1. There is nothing inherently special about playing a Chump, other than the challenge, the excitement of being weak, and the drama potential it brings. When a Chump reaches level 1, they become slightly more skilled.

\subsubsection*{Class Change}
Once the chump reaches level 1, they roll on the Class Change table instead of rolling for a talent. It's possible that a Chump that wasn't an animal or a creature of imagination becomes a Talking Animal or an Imagined. This is intentional. Chumps adopt the HIT VALUE and HITS of their new class, keep their existing skills, and gain the new class's skills through the starting skills table. Their appearence can be changed through the new class' appearence table. They don't get the new class' starting gear.
