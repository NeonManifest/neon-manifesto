\section{Adventuring Gear}
Each PLAYER or FOE character has 12 maximum burden, which they can use to carry gear. Each point of burden is identified by an equipment slot, inside of which there can be an item of gear or part of an item. This chapter describes adventuring gear in three distinct tiers: basic; advanced; and magic. The items described, however, are not an exhaustive list of every piece of gear that can exist in every Neon Manifesto game world, but a set of common and suggested gear with help on how to adjudicate each. PLAYERS and CONDUCTORS may add new pieces of gear to the game world, though it's up to the CONDUCTOR to classify gear between the three tiers.
